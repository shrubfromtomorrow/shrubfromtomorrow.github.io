          <div id="learningPlanVision">My name is Orion Andrews, I am a senior at Gibson Ek High School.<br /> I have a
            passion for programming and mathematics as
            well as web design. I really would like to explore more and more avenues that relate to programming to find
            a speciality
            that I enjoy. I spend most of my working hours developing my personal portfolio as well as working on many
            programming
            projects small and large. My aim is to graduate and attend university. I have several schools in mind, all
            of which are
            in the UK or Australia. <br />At any school, I will study computer science and hopefully mathematics. By the
            end
            of this
            learning cycle, I wish to have a first prototype for my capstone project's calculator input system. I also
            wish to add a
            project page for my lighting project to my portfolio that features a revamped styling method with more
            flexible CSS. I
            aim to write some projects in Rust to flex some low-level muscles as well.<br /> For me, a successful high
            school
            career would
            entail graduating with a capstone project that contains, at the very least, a usable calculator UI that
            emulates the
            functionality of a TI calculator.

            My internship this year is with Ranjani Vasan. She works as a systems engineer (I believe) at Amazon and she
            is helping my through the general user experience of my portfolio (the one you are on). She has already
            provided valuable insight into the flaws of my current design and led to me create a more seperated design
            for one of my more content-heavy pages for easier navigation.<br /> In the future, I hope she can provide

            My capstone started with me being mildly irritated. I had to buy a graphing calculator for the ACT and found
            the
            selection limited. <br />Adding to my anger was the quality of the $150 product. The machine was slow,
            poorly
            made,
            seemed to have had no user testing, and I have really only used it thrice (programming on it doesn't
            count).<br />
            I want to solve this. I want to create an entire calculator. From user interface to hardware, I think I
            could improve almost everything that Texas Instruments has done or not done.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="right"><img src="../../../Images/fireTablet.png" id="fireTablet"></div>
        <div class="left">
          <div>After some very illuminating research, I found that the root of the problem I wanted to tackle was deeper
            than I thought. TI has a solid monopoly, they can do whatever they want in terms of pricing. Teachers are
            only taught course material through TI calculators and most College Board exams only accept TI calculators
            (College Board is also a cesspool of a company).<br />
            If I was going to try to solve this, it would be tough to break through TI's layers of lobbying and general
            sketchy practices. I decided to set my sights on proof of concept rather than a full takeover.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="right"><img src="../../../Images/calculatorRequirement.png" id="calculatorRequirements"></div>
        <div class="left">The first thing I needed to work on was the calculator UI. I wanted to get a quick prototype
          ready with a Raspberry Pi and a linux kernel install. However, Raspberry Pis are impossible to get
          commercially and so I do not have an option for physical prototyping yet. I decided to focus my energy on
          developing the actual calculator interface as making progress physically was effectively stonewalled. <br />
          I (as you can see here) have had some experience with web development so I decided to write the calculator
          application in JavaScript as, when using the Electron library, I am able to develop a website that loads
          natively on any desktop.</div>
