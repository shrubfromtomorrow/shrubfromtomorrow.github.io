                Around December of 2021, I found a video about controlling LEDs
                in 3D space for a Christmas tree. It was absolutely fascinating
                and I knew immediately that I wanted to do it myself. There was
                one small issue though, the video was not technical in the
                slightest. It was heavily based around what the general process
                was but it was not a guide for how to set up the LEDs, how
                program them, or really HOW to do anything. For those
                interested, the link to the video is

                ><br /><br />
                Being a programming novice who was painfully aware of how new I
                was to the field, I left the project for better days.

                One day in July of 2022, the Google algorithm gods looked down
                upon me and said "now's as good a time as any" and a video popped
                into my YouTube feed. It was pretty unassuming, just a guide on
                how to wire some WS2811 LEDs. I watched the video and came to
                the realization that, I knew how to start!<br /><br />
                Now of course, I did know a good way to start the project, as it
                semi-prominently featured in the video I watched initially
                regarding Christmas trees, but more importantly, I knew how to
                write the code.<br /><br />
                And so my journey began.

                This is where the images start but there was an intense electrical debugging session that occured before I came close to this point, so that is what I will walk you through.<br/> <br/>
                There had been some lights and a Raspberry Pi 3b hanging around my house for a while so those were the first things I got, following the video I was recommended, I tried to wire the LEDs up.
                The tutorial, however useful, was not helpful for my set of lights. I got the basic prinicple of how to get the adapters on but there was a lot of omitted information about what pins to use on the 
                Raspberry Pi, or which end was negative, or which end took in data and which end outputted data. It took a bit of work, but I got the idea of how to match what pin on the Pi to to what area on the lights.
                I then came to the realization that the pins I needed were not magically in a row and I would need some jumper cables to carry the current between the lights and the Pi.<br/><br/>
                Fast forward 2 days and I now have the Pi wired correctly, or so I thought. I had confused the notation GPIO 18, thinking it meant PHYSCICAL pin 18, it did not.
                After getting the wiring correct (I was able to tell by the lights flashing once when I plugged them in).<br/> I wrote some code.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="firstDescpt2Cont">
              <div id="firstDescpt2">I don't have the exact code I wrote to do what it being done in the image above, but after poking around to figure out how the Neopixel library worked, I wrote some very simple stuff. Next to this is the first code I wrote that I have on record. <br/><br/>
                This is relatively simple compared to what you might have to endure later, and the basic idea is the I am testing the refresh rate of the lights. From this is was able to understand that 50 lights can refresh at 189 hertz. That is faster than most gaming monitors.<br/><br/>
                I also learned that the main thing that slows the lights updating was the .show() function (forshadowing). There is also some speed loss when using random numbere generation like I did here, but it is only a couple of seconds and since all my later tests are on the same scale, it can be disregarded.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="firstCodeCont">
              <img src="../../../Images/code1.png">
            </div>
            <div class="procedureNote1Cont">
              <div id="procedureNote1">At this point it is important to note how the code is being executed. All of the code I had written was executing on the Raspberry Pi. This is because the only way to control the lights is through the PWM pins on the Pi.
                The most important note here is that since all of the code is being executed on the Pi, all of the calculations necessary to run the program are also being done on the Pi, and that the Pi is significantly slower than my, or anybody's, laptop or computer. This becomes a problem later.
                <br/><br/>
                Also included in my verion control is some prototypical code for capturing images of the lights, this becomes extremely important as the project progresses.
