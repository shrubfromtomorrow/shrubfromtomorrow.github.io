            <div id="multiDMABuffer">The last real part of the lighting for this project (for now) comes in the form of
              an optimization. At this point, it was really slow
              to get data all the way to the end of the strip of lights (picture to explain). Now, PWM is really fast,
              but it doesn't really get to shine
              when there are microcontrollers that have to stop the data, process it, and pass it on again at every
              light. They takes AGES (microseconds) to get anything
              done, so it seems natural to try to bypass them. My thought was simple, why not use two different data
              lines to pass information and section the lights
              into even parts, that way I can simultaneously pass data into 150-light sections, HALVING the time it
              takes for the lights to get their information.<br />
              Sadly, in the code itself, you have to check whether a light is of a certain index, and that alone is
              enough to account for the time saved. However,
              there are more than just speed improvements to be had here. The lights use a combination of power from an
              external power supply with the 5 volts supplied
              from the raspberry pi's GPIO pins, by separating the lights into two sections, I effectively double the
              amount of power I can put into the lights, leading
              them to be brighter and to flicker less. Also, it means that I can use fewer raspberry pis to control more
              lights (half as many to be exact).<br /><br />
              But the sugarplum fairly land of theory must come to an end.

          <div class="DMAExplCont">
            <div id="DMAExpl">Here is the issue. When I created the code to split the output into two data lines,
              something strange happened. Basically, I had the code
              to show all of the updated lights on line one run before showing the updated lights on line two (the code
              runs fast enough that there is
              not a noticable delay), but the two outputs overrode the other line. This would cause, say, the bottom 150
              lights to update both halves and the
              top 150 lights would update both halves as well. It turns out that while the raspberry pi has multiple
              (5+) dataouts (GPIO pins) that the lights can interpret,
              there are only two LINES of output. Basically, GPIO 18 will get the same signal as, say, GPIO 22, but GPIO
              23 will have a different signal as GPIO 18.
              A diagram would be best.<br /><br />
              As you can see, there are two different lines that cover multiple output pins (the holes) and they produce
              individual outputs. Moving the wire vertically
              would not change the output thought it would change the pin number, moving horizontally would change the
              output and the pin number. So, you can only get
              2 different outputs on the different lines, great, let's use some different pins and ... it still didn't
              work. <br />

              At this point, it had been a few days (about 5) and I decided to turn to the library that all of this code
              is written on. The library itself is really just
              a massive compilation of C code as C was probably the best language to write code that deals with PWM in.
              C is illegible, at least for me, as someone who
              had, up to this point, dealt exculsively in highly abstracted high-level languages. For this, I had to
              employ my father. After some small lessons as well as
              a doomscroll through the code, we found several hints to the existence of multi-line functionality.<br />
              After a couple days, while having a look at the issue, my father tried a simple package reinstall. And
              that was it. We tested the lights again
              and the lights were being properly separated into their individual lines. I have added a video with me
              goofing around with the separate data lines.<br />
              At first, they run normally with two lines, then I take out the line for the bottom half to see them
              pause. Then I plug the 5 volt power line
              into the dataline. The voltage waveform is not as managed as it is for PWM and so the data being sent is
              just about as random as you can get. Since the
              microcontrollers on each LED only know 24 bit color values, they take a truly random value.
              I then plug them back in normally and look at the result.

          <div class="lightPlotExplCont">
            <div id="lightPlotExpl">The very last thing (again, for now) that I would like to talk about is my lightPlot
              program. A side effect of processing
              multi-megabyte images into color values is that the output file is quite large, even when repeats are
              removed. For this reason, it could become
              costly if I sent a buggy piece of code or a pattern with no end to the lights. The way that the data is
              stored before being sent out the wire into
              the lights is using a piece of memory called DMA, or Direct Media Access buffer. The data that is ready to
              be exported into the wire is queued in
              the DMA buffer until the buffer recieves a "go" command, at that point all of the data is dumped into the
              wire. The "go" command, in this case, would
              be the show() function that is used in my code. <br />
              But say I forgot to end a loop. Or more specifically, the loop ends at some extraordinary number of loops.
              Well, all the data from every loop
              before gets simultaneously dumped from the DMA buffer. That is a massive problem and if you do it
              incorrectly enough, the buffer lights
              won't turn on for several minutes and it certainly won't be what you are expecting.<br />
              For this reason, I thought it a resonable investement of time to create a testing platform for the lights.
              Using JavaScript and HTML Canvas,
              I would create a program that could take an array input of the exact same format as the output in my
              Python code, and it would display the
              lights virtually. This took a while to do, but I knew the result would be worth it. I learned a lot about
              JavasScript and if this word is a link,
              it means I have created a page to talk about it. In the end, I got exactly what I wanted, a low risk test
              environment for any pattern I wanted to
              create. You can see one example further back in the page when I demonstrate the path of the lights when
              they are stapled to the board, but here is
              another.
