            <div id="rotationTestDesc">After a couple of small optimizations, like including the light coordinates
              as a supplemental text file and being able to execute a certain program from a centralised exec file,
              I moved on to tackle rotation.
              <br /><br />
              The goal here was to create some really nice mathematical patterns using rotation. Rotation is a little
              tough, or at least it is when you don't know what you are doing. It just so happens that in the process of
              finding an effective method to represent
              rotation, I derived the 2 dimensional rotation matrix. That looks something like this:

            <div id="recap1">So, at this point I had 100 lights set up in a horribly precarious situation, I had a
              method for mapping and describing the geometric relation between the lights,
              and I had some cool patterns. Really all I did in the following weeks was add more lights and create new
              patterns. Following will be images and videos related to the light setup and the patterns I have created.
              Please be advised that almost all of the videos so far were taken with my laptop camera that gets terribly
              overexposed and is only 1280x720. The effect can be beneficial for seeing the macro of the light patterns.

            <div id="montageIntermission1">And here we will take a pause. It is worth noting that, as of now, I have 30
              recordings of various quality, I only wished to put the highlights in though.
              I wanted to stop here to talk about two things, the magic of HSV, and the hardships of rotation.
              <br /><br />
              I'll start with the big issue I had with rotation as it ties in with the spiral you see.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="rotationIssueCont">
            <div id="rotationIssue">One piece of code I had written involved finding what angle about a circle a point
              lay on. In order to find that, with the x and y coordinates I had, I needed to use arctan.
              <br /><br />Using the ratio of opposite over adjacent, I would be able to find the radian measure of
              a point about my origin. This works because where tangent takes in an angle value and will return a ratio
              between two lengths (though what the lengths are is not explicit), the inverse function of tangent
              (arctangent) takes in a ratio of side lengths and returns an angle measure.
              The range of these return values is between π/2 and -π/2 and so using some basic if statements I was able
              to determine which quadrant of the circle the point lay in and I would add π/2 if it was in the second or
              third. Arctan is shown below.
              <br /><br />
              <img
                src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\LARGE&space;\color{white}r&space;=&space;\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})">
              <br /><br />
              The issue with this is that the ratio of opposite over adjacent could return undefined. In the situation
              where the adjacent side, or the x value, is 0, you would have an undefined output. And it just so happens
              that in my real lighting setup, with my camera of 921,600 pixels, I had a light sitting EXACTLY on the y
              axis (an x value of 0).
              This was extremely difficult to debug as the error only occured on the 8th rotation (144 degrees) and it
              was on light 270. This is truly fascinating as the likelihood of a light being on the y-axis at any
              rotation is 720/921,600 or 0.078%. Not to mention that my decimal precision was set to 8, so the value of
              the adjacent side was less than 0.00000000.

            <img id="rotationImage" src="../../../../Images/rotationImage.png">
          </div>
          <div class="rotationAndSpiralCont">
            <div id="rotationAndSpiral">The whole point of dealing with rotation at all was at the challenge of a
              friend. After showing them all the things I could do mathematically with the lights, they said I should
              create a spiral.
              A spiral came across as pretty daunting but it is actually quite simple.<br /><br />
              <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\LARGE&space;\color{white}r=\theta"><br /><br />
              That's it. Using a different constant in front of theta would allow for a bigger or smaller spiral and
              that is all I needed.
              <br /><br />
              With this, I would calculate a certain number of points, say 50, that would fit perfectly into a spiral
              shape. I would then use that code written earlier to figure out which lights
              were closest to each point and I would light them. Once one spiral was illuminated, I would rotate all of
              the points using the matrix math above and I would get a new spiral.
              <br /><br />
              This feels to me like a dramatic oversimplification, but it really isn't. The principle is quite simple,
              the execution is another problem.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="rotationComputationIssueCont">
            <div id="rotationComputationIssue">My methods for transferring the data regarding the lights that needed to
              be lit at this point had been precarious. The first way I did it was by computing all the lights that
              needed to be on, in
              order, and then I sent those lights as arguments to the file execution in the command line where they were
              interpreted on the other side. Bad idea. The main issue with this is that you could only really send one
              pattern at a time without
              writing some complex way to parse the light numbers on the raspberry pi side. There is also some character
              limit in the shell I use that is somewhere around 5000.
              <br /><br />
              After realizing I wanted to do this in a more efficient way. I decided to write an execution program that
              would send a certain file to the raspberry pi, compute all of the
              lights and their coordinates there, and then light them up. This worked ok. However, as I mentioned
              before, doing the calculations on the raspberry pi is limited and if you are doing something like, say,
              calculating all of the points
              on a spiral of a certain size and doing a bunch of trig to find the closest lights, you would have a long
              pause between animated frames.
              <br /><br />
              The last, and current, method of data transfer comes in the form of precomputation on my computer.
              Effectively, I do everything I need to, calculation-wise, on my laptop and then I export a
              "lightOrder.txt" file that contains a list of lists of lights that would need to be turned on at any given
              time. I then have a second piece of code that parses the lightOrder however I want.
              For example, I could write that I wanted to sleep the program for 1 second between frames; I would write a
              sleep function into the parser each time it reads a list of lights.
              This removes a lot of strain from the raspberry pi and is just a more stable and structured way of
              actually lighting the lights.

          <!-- <div></div> -->
          <div class="jackCodeCont">
            <div id="jackCode">
              When I first made the spiral code, I was calculating each frame on the raspberry pi. Given that it had to
              do at least 15,000 trig calculations (50 points, 300 lights to check distance), the frames came out really
              slowly. This was what pushed me to
              change the way I sent the data to precalculation with the lightOrder file. However, I wanted it to be
              faster. The first thing to do here would be to use complex numbers rather than matrix multiplication.
              Complex numbers are actually so commonly used
              to represent rotation that the creators of Python made them a built-in function of the language. The way
              complex numbers work for rotations best visualized with a picture.<br /><br />
              A complex number is denoted by Z = Ai + B. i is the square root of -1. In our normal number system, no
              number can be squared and equal -1, it just doesn't work. Thinking of the complex plane
              as a number line that is perpendicular to our normal number line means that multiplying any number by i
              will rotate it 90 degrees. If 5 is our starting point, multiplying by i give 5i. Multiplying by
              i again give 5i*i and since i is the square root of -1, multiplying i by itself gives -1, and multiplying
              -1 by 5 give -5. So multiplying by i is equivalent to a 90 degree rotation, but what about a more general
              formula? Well, this is it:<br /><br />
              <img
                src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\LARGE&space;\color{white}(\cos{\theta}&space;&plus;&space;i\sin{\theta})(x&space;&plus;&space;iy)">
              <br /><br />
              This for θ being the angle by which you would like to rotation a point. This is only applicable for
              counterclockwise rotation. This code is faster than the
              matrix multiplication counterpart as it doesn't need to import another library and it only requires 2 trig
              functions.<br />
              Another way to speed this up is by creating a lookup table for rotational values. For example, if I am
              rotation by 18 degrees, I could create a lookup table for all the trig functions I would
              need to perform. Given that there are only 20 distinct angles, this is very feasible.<br />
              The last method of optimization came from a friend who realized that by changing the spiral's starting
              point angle, all subsequent angles would be rotated already
              as the spiral is built off of the last point's position. That code runs way faster and I have added a
              video of what it looks like.

          <div class="HSVCont">
            <div id="HSV">Now, on to the second point I mentioned earlier, this will be more brief. HSV is a color
              standard, like RGB, but rather than taking
              3, 8-bit values to represent different amounts of red, green, and blue, HSV takes a Hue, a Saturation, and
              a Value. HSV was actually created in the first place
              for purposed related to computer graphics. My main use of it was as a way to iterate through the
              traditional rainbow.<br /><br />
              The traditional rainbow has 7 values, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, inigo, and violet. With RGB, I was
              unable to find a way to programmatically iterate through
              certain values of red, green, or blue so as to allow myself to create a rainbow. HSV, on the other hand,
              has the ability to do this quite easily as the
              hue value (as in the number, not the V in HSV) is measured in degrees. This would take far too long to
              explain so I will just add a picture.

            <div id="HSVExpl">Now, I did not use this very much simply because I didn't need to make a rainbow or use
              any other method of iterating
              through hues that much, but it was a cool revelation that it was possible to create a rainbow so easily
              just by changing the angle around the cylinder.
              I did create a rainbow with this concept so I will add that.
